# Data Processing

We do not provide the datasets to avoid their leakage in the wild. You can download each of the datasets from the sources provide in their papers by their original authors and place them under `raw_data`. Each of the notebooks then handles the preprocessing for one of the datasets.

The processed data then goes to the `prepared_data` dir.
